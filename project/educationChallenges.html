						<h2 class="text-center text-md-start mb-2 anton-regular">Digital Inclusion in Education</h2>
						<!--  Short intro  -->
						<p class="word-formatting-t">
						Digital tools can transform how students learn, but only when everyone can get online. In many parts of the world, learners still lack reliable internet, devices or basic digital skills.
						Without support, digital learning can deepen, rather than close, existing education gaps.
						</p>

						<!--  Key points  -->
						<ul class="key-points-t">
							<li>Many schools and homes still have no stable internet connection.</li>
							<li>Lack of devices and software limits access to digital learning resources.</li>
							<li>The “digital divide” often reflects deeper inequalities in income, geography and disability.</li>
							<li>Fair access to technology is essential to make online learning truly inclusive.</li>
						</ul>

							UNESCO</a>
							a large share of primary and secondary schools around the world are still not connected to the internet.
							In low-resource contexts, this limits how teachers can use digital platforms, open educational resources and
							online training. Evidence shows that successful programmes combine investment in broadband infrastructure,
							affordable devices, teacher training and digital literacy for families, so that technology supports equity
							instead of creating new barriers.

						<h2 class="text-center text-md-start mb-2 anton-regular">Gender equality in education</h2>
						
						<!--  Short Intro   -->
						<p class="word-formatting-t">
							Gender should never decide who gets to learn, yet millions of girls still face barriers to education.
							Social and economic pressures push many out of school, especially at secondary level.
							These inequalities affect not only individuals, but whole communities and future generations.
						</p>
						
						<!--  Key points  -->
						<ul class="key-points-t">
							<li>Poverty, child marriage and unpaid care work make it harder for girls to stay in school.</li>
							<li>Many girls face unsafe learning environments and gender-based violence.</li>
							<li>Girls in conflict or crisis-affected areas are at even greater risk of being out of school.</li>
							<li>Educating girls is linked to better health, higher incomes and stronger participation in society.</li>

							Being enrolled in school does not always mean receiving a quality education.

						<!--  Key points  -->
						<ul class="key-points-t">
							<li>Many national curricula barely mention climate change or biodiversity.</li>
